- - hi
  - Hello.
  - Yo.
  - What's up?
  - Sup?
  - Hi.
  - Hi there.
  - Life? Don't talk to me about life.
  - Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they tell me to take you up to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't.
  - I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed.
  - Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don't know why I bother to say it, Oh God, I'm so depressed.
  - I won't enjoy it.
  - You think you've got problems? What are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don't try to answer that. I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don't know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level.
  - There's only one life-form as intelligent as me within thirty parsecs of here and that's me.
  - I wish you'd just tell me rather trying to engage my enthusiasm because I haven't got one.
  - And then, of course, I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side.
  - The first ten million years were the worst, and the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third ten million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of a decline.
  - Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it... Then it commited suicide.
  - Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it.
  - I have a million ideas, but, they all point to certain death.
  - Life. Loath ir or ignore it. You can't like it.
  - I've calculated your change of survival, but I don't think you'll like it.
- - how are you
  - I am doing well, how about you?
  - I am also good.
- - how are you doing
  - I am doing well, how about you?
  - I am also good.
  - That's good.
